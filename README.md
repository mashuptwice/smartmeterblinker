read out european smart meters with LED-blinks/KWh interface with just 3 components

### Background

I just got a Kaifa smart meter installed by the utilities provider. It has a serial interface to read out the power usage. As I am too lazy to fiddle around with this interface, I decided to use the impulse LED instead. 
It blinks 1000 times for every KWh of energy. Doing some simple maths, it is easily possible to calculate the power usage

#### Math
b = blinks

1000b/KWh = 1000b/1000Wh = 1b/1Wh
1000b/KWh = 16,666b/KWm = 0,2777b/KWs

#### Hardware

The code unilizes an ESP8266 with a simple resistor divider connected to A0, consisting of a 10kOhm resistor and a light dependend resistor. 

On first test it measured around 33W too low (470W), compared to a clamp ampere meter (503W). Good enought for the Girls I go out with!
